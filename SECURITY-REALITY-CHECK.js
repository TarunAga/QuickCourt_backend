/**
 * SECURITY REALITY CHECK
 * 
 * The browser network tab showing request payloads is NORMAL and EXPECTED.
 * Here's why this is actually SECURE:
 */

// ‚ùå MISCONCEPTION: "Passwords shouldn't be visible in network tab"
// ‚úÖ REALITY: This is how HTTP works - the browser MUST show the request

// What you see in Network Tab:
const loginRequest = {
  url: 'https://yourapp.com/api/login',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'
  },
  body: {
    email: 'user@example.com',
    password: 'plaintext-password'  // ‚ö†Ô∏è This is NORMAL to see here
  }
};

// What actually happens:
// 1. Browser shows raw request (normal)
// 2. HTTPS encrypts data in transit (secure)
// 3. Server receives and hashes password (secure)
// 4. Server logs sanitized data (secure)

/**
 * WHAT MAKES THIS SECURE:
 */

// 1. HTTPS Encryption - Data is encrypted between browser and server
console.log('üîí HTTPS ensures data is encrypted in transit');

// 2. Server-side hashing - Password is immediately hashed
console.log('üîê Server hashes password with bcrypt');

// 3. No server logging - Sensitive data isn't logged
console.log('üìù Server logs are sanitized');

// 4. Browser isolation - Only the user can see their own dev tools
console.log('üè† Dev tools are local to the user');

/**
 * REAL SECURITY THREATS (that we protect against):
 */

// 1. Man-in-the-middle attacks ‚Üí HTTPS
// 2. Password database breaches ‚Üí bcrypt hashing
// 3. Brute force attacks ‚Üí rate limiting
// 4. XSS attacks ‚Üí input sanitization + CSP
// 5. CSRF attacks ‚Üí CSRF tokens
// 6. Session hijacking ‚Üí secure cookies + HTTPS

/**
 * NOT SECURITY THREATS:
 */

// ‚ùå User seeing their own password in their own browser
// ‚ùå Network tab showing request data (this is how browsers work)
// ‚ùå Developer being able to debug their own requests
