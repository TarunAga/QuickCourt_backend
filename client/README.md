# React Frontend App

This is a basic React frontend application. It provides a starting point for building your React-based web application.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
